The key to resolving pull requests involves pulling the current project (development) code to your feature branch. git checkout <feature-branch-name> git pull upstream development. Then you must Edit the files to resolve the conflicts,  Commit the changes. git add, and then Push the changes to your personal repository. Finally you can Confirm that conflicts have been fixed. The repository is organized as a collection of files and folders, that contain each files revision history. File history appears in snapshots in time called commits and can be broken down into further development lines called branches. Contributions seem to evaluated in a hierarchical fashion.
